# $\varepsilon$

A collection of interesting coding challenges,
mostly inspited by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

This repository is structured as a standard Haskell project,
using [`cabal`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), as a package manager
and build tool that uses the [**GHC**](https://www.haskell.org/ghc) compiler for Haskell.

The easiest way to get `cabal`, **GHC**, and all others relevant to the Haskell toolchain
is using [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

To build the project, run `cabal build` in the root directory.

To _build and run_, use `cabal run`.

All solutions are written in Haskell.
